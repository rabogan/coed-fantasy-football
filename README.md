# ⚽️ Co-Ed Fantasy Football Selector

This is my personal submission for the **Snap Engineering Academy Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project**, themed around real-world football matchups and inspired by Premier League Fantasy UI design.

The project uses structured player data, HTML/CSS for design, and **vanilla JavaScript** for all interactivity — in full accordance with SEA guidelines.
