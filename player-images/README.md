## üëã Welcome to Bobby Bogan's Page

This document outlines my personal journey and technical implementation for an important project. It serves both as a reference for reviewers and a learning journal for myself.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Cloning the Repository

**Repo URL:** [https://github.com/correctURL](https://github.com/correctURL)

```bash
# In VS Code Terminal or external terminal
git clone the repo
cd into-your-directory
```

## üîß Step 2: Setting Up the Environment

### Using Five Server (Preferred for this Project)

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Install the **Five Server** extension:
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for `Five Server`
   - Click **Install**
3. Right-click `index.html` ‚Üí `Open with Five Server`

### Why Five Server?

- Faster reloads.
- Multi-device testing (e.g., view on phone + laptop).
- Built-in browser DevTools overlay.

## üß† Step 3: Planning the Project

> _"Plan before you code"_ ‚Äî Advice I'm taking to heart!

- Revisited my earlier web dev studies:
  - [My ColtSteelePractice HTML/CSS/JS archive](https://rabogan.github.io/ColtSteelePractice/index.html)

- Project Theme: **Co-Ed Dream Team ‚Äì Fantasy Squad Builder**
  - 6-a-side format: 1 GKP, 2 DEF, 1 MID, 2 ATT
  - Inspired by Premier League Fantasy UI and built with responsive mobile design in mind

- Dataset Source:
  - **EA Sports FC 25: Ratings and Stats** by [Davis Nyagami on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nyagami/ea-sports-fc-25-database-ratings-and-stats?resource=download)
  - Top 20 men and 10 women from Real Madrid (M/W) and Arsenal (M/W)
  - JSON + CSV versions maintained
  - Images sourced from Wikimedia Commons and stored in `/player-images/`
  - Attribution saved in `images/credits.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Building the Project (Work in Progress)

### Key Milestones Reached

‚úÖ Player cards designed and tested  
‚úÖ Pitch layout created using Flexbox  
‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness implemented  
‚úÖ All player data loaded from JSON  
‚úÖ Info (`‚ÑπÔ∏è`) buttons open a player modal  
‚úÖ Modal includes player image, stats, and attribution  
‚úÖ Clicking outside the modal or pressing "X" closes it  
‚úÖ Modal now uses smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions  
‚úÖ Team circle indicators (red/white/gray) added with styling  
‚úÖ Player list adjusted for mobile and desktop width balance  
‚úÖ Finalized player layout for pitch + sidebar  
‚úÖ Removed unnecessary placeholders and debug test output

- `name`
- `position`
- `rating`
- `age`
- `nationality`
- `club`
- `gender`
- `player_image`
- `image_credit`

---

### Layout

  - Responsive behavior on phones: player list stacks below pitch

- Player entries:
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è info button to trigger modal
